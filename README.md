# HW14-JS
JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

A code is needed to create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. It is also needed to allow users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

## Tasks
I used the index.html file provided and included a NASA picture in the background.

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote a code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

There is a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

I used a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
